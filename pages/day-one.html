<h1>Why</h1>

<h2><a href="http://www.sjvpartnership.org">Partnership Website</a></h2>
<p>When the work group web pages needed their homepage columns resized, we had to go back to the developer.<br><br>
It was going to be $200 - to change two numbers. Ultimately, Bertz-Rosa group (our consultant) couldn't get in touch with the developer; so they had to find someone else.<br><br>
In the meantime, my director suggested I check out Bitwise. He knew Jake Soberol. So I checked out their website; found Geekwise Academy and Boot Camp One; and signed up. Since this is a work-related class, my tuition was compensated by my department<br><br>
When I heard from Bertz-Rosa group, they said they found another developer who could change the columns. He was from Bitwise. Talk about cosmic confirmation that I should take this class!
